        <h1>History</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The SBOA School and Junior College at Anna Nagar West was started in 1979 by SBIOA Educational Trust formed by the State Bank of India Officers' Association (Chennai Circle) then headed by its General Secretary, Shri E A G Moses. The purpose of starting the School was to let the children of the Officers of State Bank of India continue their education when their SBI Officer parents get transferred. Many of them found it extremely difficult to get admission in any of the other Schools in the city. The School was started with 13 teachers and the rooves of the class rooms initially were thatched. Shri E A G Moses contributed Rs.8000/- initially and contributions from other Officers followed. Many fund raising cultural events were also held to raise funds for construction of the buildings and get other infrastructures required for the School. The Educational Trust slowly expanded by opening Schools in Madurai, Coimbatore, Tiruchirapalli and Ernakulam. Its foundation was timed to coincide with the International Year of the Child - 1979. The first principal was Shirley Ray.

The SBIOA runs other schools in the south Indian states of Kerala and Tamilnadu</p>
